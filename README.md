# Phone-VR-Device
My project I am creating for TEJ4M and hopefully this project will be able to provide people with a cheap alternative to buying a expensive headset by swapping out the head mounted display (HMD) and IMU for your phones display and internal IMU. Creating the controllers for the HMD will need external sensor which you can set up around the room.
