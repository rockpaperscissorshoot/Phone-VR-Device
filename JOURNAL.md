## 10/27/2025 - Signed up for Blueprint :)  

This isn't a big achievement however it's nice to have started a project. I currently have part procurement first in my project however since it's the first time designing a project it seems I will need to adjust my personal time line to fit blueprint's timeline. So the way blueprint has there service is that to receive funding for Blueprint i will need to provide a cad files and other files to prove the validity of my project and after that they will send funding after review the document. However as you see in my estimate below I put cadding (which is apparently not a word) very later. So I'll have to change the entire process of how I'm creating the project. ![Screenshot 2025-10-27 094359](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTkzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ec3ac0a4a03a9e972019b26e69abe372963ffd78/Screenshot%202025-10-27%20094359.png) Hopefully I find a solution because I need to finish planning my project to include both requirement's for school and Blueprint.
